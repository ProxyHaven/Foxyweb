# Foxyweb

This project uses [XULWeb](http://github.com/ProxyHaven/XULWeb) and emulates [gBrowser apis]() to run Firefox inside of the web. Yes, you heard me right. Many [proxy middlewares](https://github.com/ProxyHaven/Middleware-Spec) are used such as [Extension Emulator](https://github.com/ProxyHaven/Middleware/tree/unstable/ExtEmu) to provide universal proxy support.
